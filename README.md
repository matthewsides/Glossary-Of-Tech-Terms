## [1] Scrum 

Scrum is a framework for project management that emphasizes teamwork, accountability and iterative progress toward a well-defined goal. 

### 10 Key SCRUM Terms

#### 1. Sprint

Sprint is an iteration of work in which an increment of product functionality is implemented. This usually lasts 30 days, though may vary depending on the situation and amount of time allocated or avaliable.

#### 2. Sprint Backlog

Sprint Backlog essentially defines the work for a sprint represented by the tasks and must be met or completed to realize the sprint goals. 

#### 3. SCRUM Roles

There are three essential roles in any Scrum project;Product Owner,Scrum Master, Team.

####  4. Impediments

An Impediment is anything preventing a team member from working productivly or efficiently.Each team member has an opportunity to announce impediments during the daily Scrum meeting. The ScrumMaster is charged with ensuring impediments get resolved. 

#### 5. Product Backlog

The product backlog is the requirements for a system, expressed as a prioritized list of product backlog Items (tasks set on list set by priority level). 

#### 6. Product Backlog Item

In Scrum, a product backlog item is a unit of work small enough to be completed by a team in one Sprint iteration.

#### 7. Team

A team (or "Scrum team") is optimally comprised of a group of people working together to acheive a certain goal.

#### 8. Team Member

In Scrum parlance (terminology) , a team member is defined as anyone working on sprint tasks toward the sprint goal.

#### 9. Velocity

In Scrum, velocity is how much product backlog effort a team can handle in one sprint. This can be estimated by viewing previous sprints.

#### 10. Daily Scrum Meeting

A fifteen-minute daily meeting supervised by the Scrum Master for each team member to answer three questions:

"What have I done since the last Scrum meeting? (i.e. yesterday)"

"What will I do before the next Scrum meeting? (i.e. today)"

"What prevents me from performing my work as efficiently as possible?"

## [2] Programming Paradigms    

A programming paradigm is a style, or ‚Äúway,‚Äù of programming.

### Procedural

Procedural programming is a paradigm based on the concept of using procedures. Procedure (sometimes also called subprogram, routine or method) is a sequence of commands to be executed.

### Event Driven

Event-driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the flow of program execution is determined by events - for instance a user action such as a mouse click, key press, or a message from the operating system or another program.

### Object Orientated

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm organized around objects rather than "actions" and data rather than logic.

## [3] Algorithms

An algorithm is a set of instruction, used for calculations or other problem-solving operations.

### Implementation proccess of Algorithm

#### 1. Establish the Rules of a Problem

A problem can usually be interpreted in multiple ways and the response is what is integral in this instance, though complications may be encountered, the proccess of figuring out what went wrong is the ideology that programming is based around (the point of programming).

#### 2. Explore the problem space

The above heading or idea of 'explore the problem space' essentially refering to not constraining (rigorous constraints)  yourself whilst thinking and solving the problem,as this usually leads to long lists of steps that may not necessarily coincide with the steps of an algorithm. Inconjunction with the idea of exploring the problem space rather then constraning oneself, it is acceptable to note loose ideas of a plan down, though it must be acknowledged that the problem is still in the thought proccess stage ( your still thinking of the problem) and that the list of ideas may not be the most ambiable (suitable) to solving the problem.  

#### 3. Specify a plan and elaborate into steps

Essentially put the overall plan into simple steps (flow chart or sudo code is applicable) that may be read and understood after a brief flick, ensure that  pronouns aren't used and be very specific. 

Optionally verify each step in the process for some simple input. Though ensure that there is no confusion as to what should happen and is happening, preferably pretending that you do not know the function or purpose of the pseudocode or what its doing when reading through it (Note: could ask external help for this). 

#### 4. Translate each step into code 

This step is deterministic, since the code language used is relative and as long as the steps translated into a High-Level-programming language are the same, the outcome should be similiar after the code is compiled into Machine-code or Lower-level.

## [4] IDE

An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software suite that consolidates the basic tools developers need to write and test software.
